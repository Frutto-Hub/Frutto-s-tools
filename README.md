# Mesh-Optimiser
### Simple blender addon for fast mesh optimisation
# What does this addon does?
1. Affects **only** on all selected mesh-type objects
1. Removes all double vertices with maximum distance of 0.0001m from the mesh
1. Makes 'tris to quads' operation with compare UV's option enabled
1. Changes shading mode to smooth shading
1. Enables auto smooth option
1. Auto smooth angle can be changed by user

# Installation
1. Click on "MeshOptimiser_v.X.X.X.zip" file below on this page, this will downlad the MeshOptimiser_v.X.X.X.zip file on your computer
2. Go to Blender -> Edit -> Preferences -> Add-Ons -> Install > find "MeshOptimiser_v.X.X.X.zip" file and click install
3. Mesh Optimiser addon will appear in addon list. Tick the check-box to enable it

# Usage
1. In 3D View in N panel, you will find Mesh Optimiser Tab, choose this tab.
1. Make sure you are in object mode and select all objects you want to optimised (you can select any objects, like camera, lamp, armature, etc. but it will only affect mesh).
1. Change desired smooth angle and then press Optimise Mesh button.
1. Done! All your selected mesh-objects ane now optimised and you don't need to do 'monkey job' 🐵 yourself to make that to every object manually

# Further development
I am planning to make some improvements in the future for this addon. Like adding a parameter to change distance between double vertices, and also adding parameters that 'tris to quads' operation has in blender.
